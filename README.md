# LD38-One-Room

This is a platforming game example made to try out the Godot to API and to prepare a video tutorial series on GDquest. It is an experiment to see how things have to be done with the engine. I tried to use the kinematic body and to draw shapes directly in the editor. This project was a good occasion to explore all of the topics I'm looking to cover on the [GDquest](http://youtube.com/c/gdquest) YouTube channel.

## The game

The player sits in a room and has to get out of the areas that randomly appear to increase his score.

I didn't have time to refine the game at all, so the areas are purely randomly generated, making for rent and gameplay. It's lacking smarter patterns, i.e. using the player position to create zones to force him to move.

The code itself includes comments so feel free to use it as a reference or even copy and refactor parts for your projects.
